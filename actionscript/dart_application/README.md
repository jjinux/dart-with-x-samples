This is an example of how to use Dart with ActionScript.

Setup

This is a typical Dart application. You can open it up in Dart Editor or run
"pub install" from the command line.

Interesting Files
-----------------

* `transcript.md` This is where I'll put the transcript for the video I plan on recording.

* This directory is a Dart application. It has a pubspec.yaml in it.

* `web/dart_application.dart` This is the main Dart code.

* `web/flash_application` This is the Flash application. I wouldn't normally have all the source for my application in a public directory, but it makes setting things up easier.

* `web/flash_application/Document.as` This is the main ActionScript code.
